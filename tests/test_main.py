```**Key changes in tests:**
*   The `temp_data_dir` fixture is simplified to `temp_csv_input` which just creates the necessary input file in a temporary structure.
*   Monkeypatching `PROJECT_ROOT` is removed as `main.py` is no longer structured around it in this "pure config" model.
*   The test now directly passes the path of the temporary input CSV to `process_some_data`.
*   The output file path is also checked relative to the temporary structure.

**Step 7: Create `.gitignore`**
(Same as the previous step 7 – ensure `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `data/processed_output.csv`, `data/data_processing.log`, etc., are ignored).

**Step 8: Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml`**
(Same as the previous step 8 – tool configurations in `pyproject.toml` will be picked up). Remember that `additional_dependencies` for `mypy` hook are still crucial.
